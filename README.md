## Project Members

## Project Description

VR-like 'The Force Awakens' sandbox game. With one hand, allow the user to use the 'force' to pickup and manipulate objects from a distance with a combination of their hands and eyes, and with the other, they have a light saber to cut objects into pieces. Then they can use both hands to levitate and move around their environment. 

## Technical Features

- Selection (maybe non-standard) with force 
- Manipulation with the force
- Travel: point both hands to levitate, then point in the opposite direction to move.
- System Control: Menu for choosing main hand + light saber color
- Symbolic Input maybe for choosing light saber color (RGB)
- Interactive Tutorial: For teaching how to use the force powers
- Spatial Audio: picking up and throwing around objects. 

## Creative Efforts

- Nice particles and effects for force powers such as lighting and interacting with objects with powers. Effects when cutting through objects.
- Create a relatively detailed but flexible environment that the user can interact with and destroy.
- Easter eggs.???

## Screenshots

Holding with cone pointer. Can also throw objects.

### Updates (3/18/19)
- Selection: Done - Non-standard method, hybrid between cone selection and raycasting, but from headset toward controller
- Manipulation: Done
- Travel: Done - Non-standard method, move holding hands at sides to levitate and point them to move
- System Control: Done - Lightsaber can be grabbed from toolbelt and used as a melee weapon
- Symbolic Input: Pending?  We're still looking at letting the user change the lightsaber color
- Interactive Tutorial: In progress.  Prompts have been added to game world, but they still need to be made interactive.
- Spatial Audio: Abandoned.


We've created an arena using free Asset Store assets, complete with turrets shooting at an AI running around the map randomly.  The user will have to destroy all turrets by throwing boxes at them with the Force or by hitting them with their lightsaber.
