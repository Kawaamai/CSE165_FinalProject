## Project Description

VR-like 'The Force Awakens' sandbox game. With one hand, allow the user to use the 'force' to pickup and manipulate objects from a distance with a combination of their hands and eyes, and with the other, they have a light saber to cut objects into pieces. Then they can use both hands to levitate and move around their environment. 

## Technical Features

- Selection (maybe non-standard) with force 
- Manipulation with the force
- Travel: point both hands to levitate, then point in the opposite direction to move.
- System Control: Menu for choosing main hand + light saber color
- Symbolic Input maybe for choosing light saber color (RGB)
- Interactive Tutorial: For teaching how to use the force powers
- Spatial Audio: picking up and throwing around objects. 

## Creative Efforts

- Nice particles and effects for force powers such as lighting and interacting with objects with powers. Effects when cutting through objects.
- Create a relatively detailed but flexible environment that the user can interact with and destroy.
- Easter eggs.???
